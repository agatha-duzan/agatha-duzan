# About Me:
I'm a master student in **Data Science** at EPFL, after a bachelor's in **Mathematics** from the same university. 
During my studies, I have been the president of 
<a href="https://go.epfl.ch/sail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safe AI Lausanne</a>
, taught at the 
<a href="https://www.aisafetycamp.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swiss AI Safety Bootcamp</a>
, and also tapped in VC with 
<a href="https://www.campus.founderful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Founderful Campus</a>.
I‚Äôm driven by impact, creativity, and the thrill of learning: _create and make things happen!_ üöÄ I'm especially passionate about **AI** and **AI Safety**, where technology meets impactful change.

üöÄ **Hackathon and Competition Enthusiast:** I thrive on innovation and collaboration, and hackathons are my playground. Solving problems under pressure is my jam, and I have

 <a href="https://www.apartresearch.com/project/discovering-latent-knowledge-in-language-models-without-supervision-extensions-and-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">victories</a> 
under my belt. Beyond hackathons, I‚Äôve also competed (and proudly finished on the podium!) in international mathematical and logical games competitions.

ü•ã **Sports & Adventure Lover:** Competitive figure skating? Check. Martial arts? Scuba diving? Skydiving? Check, check, and check. I thrive on pushing limits and chasing adventures, whether on ice, underwater, or in free fall. I also like to repair and fly ultralight planes (ULM).

üé® When I‚Äôm not coding, I love to paint and draw. You will find me in the quiet corner of a museum with charcoal all over my hands.

üåç I grew up in France, Peru, and Argentina, which gifted me the beautiful skill of confidently mixing up grammar in three different ways‚Äîand somehow making it work!
